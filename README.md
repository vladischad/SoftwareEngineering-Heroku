# gradle-getting-started

A barebones Gradle app, which can easily be deployed to Heroku.

This application support the [Getting Started with Gradle on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-gradle-on-heroku) article - check it out.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have Java installed.  Also, install the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/heroku/gradle-getting-started.git
$ cd gradle-getting-started
$ ./gradlew stage
$ heroku local web
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

If you're going to use a database, ensure you have a local `.env` file that reads something like this:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/gradle_database_name
```

## Deploying to Heroku

Using resources for this example app counts towards your usage. [Delete your app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli-commands#heroku-apps-destroy) and [database](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#removing-the-add-on) as soon as you are done experimenting to control costs.

By default, apps use Eco dynos if you are subscribed to Eco. Otherwise, it defaults to Basic dynos. The Eco dynos plan is shared across all Eco dynos in your account and is recommended if you plan on deploying many small apps to Heroku. Learn more about our low-cost plans [here](https://blog.heroku.com/new-low-cost-plans).

Eligible students can apply for platform credits through our new [Heroku for GitHub Students program](https://blog.heroku.com/github-student-developer-program).

```sh
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```
